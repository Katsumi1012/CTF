But after struggling for a while I decided to switch to SSTI when trying payload `${{<%[%'"}}%\.` web returned error. Follow this methodology, I know this is `Twig SSTI`

Trying [Twig - Code execution](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection#twig---code-execution) combine with the [hint](https://www.branchcms.com/learn/docs/developer/twig/filters/item/sort) (30 point :<) I have the final payload is `{{['ls',1]|sort('system')|join}}` then `{{['cat flag.txt',1]|sort('system')|join}}` and we got the flag ðŸš©
