Where am I? The flag is LITCTF{latitude,longitude} rounded to the third decimal place. (Example: LITCTF{42.444,-71.230})

# Solution:
The challenge gave me a picture, which is a screenshot after I check it using `exiftool`:

Zoom in a little bit, there is a blue sign with the number 87 and another number that is too blurry to see it:

Maybe the sign is Interstate 87 & Interstate 287?

And after a long time crawling on that road using Google Street View, I finally found it:
