# Challenge:

Welcome to HOLA CTF

FLAG Format: EHC{XXX}

# Solution:
From the beginning, the title is "Priviet", similar to Ð¿Ñ€Ð¸Ð²ÐµÑ‚ (privet), which means "Hello" in Russian. And the protocol that has "Hello" in its packet is TLS, so we can start investigating this protocol first.

We got a .pcap file. Open with `WireShark`, click on 1 packet and choose `Follow TCP Stream`

Check `Stream` and in stream 3 we saw `This is flag` in a `TLSv1.3` packet

Using ROT on CyberChef and we get the flag ðŸš©
