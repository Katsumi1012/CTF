The challenge give us only a web to ping. Try 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8 not thing happen. But we can exploit it as command injection. Try a few basic payload and we get something with `%0Aid`

`%0A` in url encode is `\n` so i try url ancode with `space` but it didn't work. So i try `horizontal tab` url encode is `%09` and it's work üåù

Let's dig into this server and see what we can get. Look around for a while, notthing special. This time i think how about print all file in the system with this payload `%0Acat%09/*` and woala üòÑ
