# Challenge:

Mrs. Clarabelle gave me this code but I don't know how to solve it. I spent almost 2 days 16 hours thinking. Maybe I need a quieter space so I can think of a solution. How about you?

FLAG Format: EHC{XXX}

# Solution:

File we get seem like base64 due to the end with `=`. Decrypt it and we get the weird output:

Search `Mrs. Clarabelle` we got the cow in a animation movie, that a big hint. I try to decrypt the output with `Cow code`

It maybe `invisible`??. Let try with `Whitespace Language` and it work!! We get the flag ðŸš©
