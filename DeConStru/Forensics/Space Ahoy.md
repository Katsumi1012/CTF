# Solution:
The challenge gave me a file named `super_secret.jpg`, using `zsteg`, `steghide`, `exiftool`, etc. I got a weird line on the comment:

Using `binwalk`, I extracted a picture from it:

Using `binwalk` again after try above tools and I found a `.wav` file:

Remember the weird line? I googled it and had the result is `sstv`:

Using a sstv decoder to decode the `.wav` file, I got a picture with QR code in it:
