# Challenge:
NASA receive a weird transmission yesterday but they were't able to decode it. I mean, it's just a bunch of gibberish. The only thing they have cracked was one word "goodbye"
They have no clue what that means though. Can you help them?

FLAG FORMAT:
dsc{[a-zA-Z0-9_]+}
# Solution:
The challenge gave me a `.txt` file, open it, and it might be a dead end just by looking at it:

Go to the end of the file and I found the sign of Base64 encode:

Decoding the file, the description had the hint "goodbye" so I find it and it right before the flag:

And we get the flag ðŸš©
