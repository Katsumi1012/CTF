# Solution:
The challenge gave me a file with password named `jason.zip`, using `john` to unzip it, there are 2 folder:

In the first folder, we have a `README.md` file:

I assume that this file is a kind of a html file, so I used a html editor online to see the clean version of it:

Nothing more, so I open the second folder, there are 3 `.txt` files and a folder that stands out, `.git`:

Open 3 files: `empty.txt`, `encode.txt`, `secret.txt` and I was rick rolled at `secret.txt`ðŸ¤¡:

Decode the line in `encode.txt`, this is a dead end:

The information in `empty.txt` leads me to the `.git' folder, so I can say the given folder is the repository of the person we're looking for
I easily found the github of Jason:

Checking `nothing_here_to_look_at`'s commit, I found the 4th file:
![image](https://github.com/Katsumi1012/CTF/assets/108376735/d4cc0964-9813-41cd-8be0-9f6ec7bc67dd)

Decoding the line using Base64 leads us to an Instagram profile:

The first picture gave us half of the flag and the second picture told us to find his Twitter:

I found him using his Instagram username to search, and there are 2 posts with two encoded lines:

Decode with the line in older post with base32, I found the second half of the flag:

And we get the flag ðŸš©
# ENJOY ðŸ¤¡
